# Hoax classification via Harmonic Boolean Label Crowdsourcing Algorithm

The notebook is written for Python 2.7. 
You will need a file, likers.json, which we are not distributing with the code.  Rather, we are distributing code with which you can generate your own dataset, should you so wish. 

voting.py contains the implementation of the Harmonic BLC algorithm.

crowdvote_paper.ipynb is the notebook used to generate the results. 
Since some of the experiments take long time (hours) to complete, we have statically assigned into variables their previous outcome, so that we can quickly regenerate the graphs if we decide to do esthetical changes for the paper.
